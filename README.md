  ## Description

  README Generator is a simple command line application for dynamically creating README's in markdown. It is my first application created with node.js and uses the FS and Inquirer packages. Through a series of command line prompts, users are able to generate a template for their README, saving time and headache.

  ## Installation

  Simply clone the repo to your machine and you're good to go.

  ## Usage

  This can be used to quickly create readme templates without having to start from scratch every time! <br>
  The template includes sections for: <br>

  - Title of your project
  - Table of contents
  - Description 
  - Usage
  - Contributions
  - Tests
  - License, if you choose to use one
  - Contact section containing a link to your github and email<br>

  After running the command "node index" in your terminal, the program will give you a series of prompts. When you've answered all of the prompts, it will generate a filled out README template for your project.
